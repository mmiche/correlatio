\title{Simulate two correlated variables.}
\usage{
simcor(obs = 100, rhos = c(-0.5, 0.5))
}
\arguments{
\item{obs}{A single integer that determines the number of simulated observations in each of the pair of variables.}

\item{rhos}{A vector with at least one value that shows the theoretical correlation between the simulated pair of variables.}
}
\value{
a list with as many data.frames (each consisting of two columns) as there are values passed to the function argument 'rhos'.
}
\description{
Apply the bootstrap evaluation of the model performance.
}
\examples{
# Simulate a list with two data.frames. The first one contains
# contains variables that are correlated by -.8, the second one
# by .7. Both data.frames contain 1000 observations.
simcor(obs = 1000, rhos = c(-.8, .7))
