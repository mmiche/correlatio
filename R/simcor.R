#' Simulate two correlated variables.
#
#' @description Simulate pairs of variables with a predefined correlation between them.
#
#' @param obs A single integer that determines the number of simulated observations in each of the pair of variables.
#
#' @param rhos A vector with at least one value that shows the theoretical correlation between the simulated pair of variables.
#
#' @return a list with as many data.frames (each consisting of two columns) as there are values passed to the function argument 'rhos'.
